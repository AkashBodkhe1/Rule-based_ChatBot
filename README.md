Rule-Based Conversational Chatbot (Python)

Project Overview
This project implements a **rule-based conversational chatbot** using **Python and Regular Expressions**.  
The chatbot simulates a simple conversation by recognizing user intent through **keyword and pattern matching**, without using any machine learning or external NLP libraries.

It is designed to demonstrate the **fundamental working of chatbots** using logic-based approaches.


Objectives
Understand how conversational chatbots work at a basic level
Implement intent recognition using keyword and regex matching
Handle unknown inputs using fallback responses
Support multiple conversation topics



Tech Stack
Language: Python  
Concepts: Regex, string processing, conditional logic  
Libraries Used: 
  - random – for randomized responses  
  - re – for regular expression based intent matching
